# JWT = JSON Web Token

* JWT has 3 parts: -> (.) : xxxx.yyyy.zzzz
    * header -> it is base64URL -encoded JSON object
    * payloads -> has claims which are about user and additional data
    * There are 3 different types of claims
            * Private
            * Public
            * Registered
    * signature
        * The JWT signature field is created by taking the encoded header, the encoded payload,
            a secret key, and using the algorithm specified in the header to cryptographically sign
            these values
